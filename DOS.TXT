-- start
ok iam think of ...
making a new ...
will i dont no what to call it...
it is going to be a editer where you can type in commands and execute them...
iam going to be makeing this program for game programing...
so the ider is to make it as esay as posabily to make games...
at the moment make games is time comsueing..
so i need to come up with a ider to make a program that can do this...
what a program like this would need is will i dont...
-- thinking
it will need away to write to the screen very fast...
it will need away to load image files...
it will need away to do transpanrt function on images...
it will need away to do colisition function...
it will need away to draw a image on top our bottom. image depth...
it will need away to get input from the keyboard. mutiepliy keys...
ok this is not helping i need to start with the editer...
--editer
the editer is a very complex thing to think abort in one go...
iam going to break it down in to three parts...
number one is going to be the interface...
number two is going to be the textediter...
number three is going to be the file opertion
--interface
the interface is the part that you see...
the interface has to send commands to the textediter to open\save\ect files...
--textediter
the textediter is a complex thing so iam going to break it down to two parts...
number one text edit this is the part where you type in your commands...
number two text color this the part where the text you type in is colored...
-- file opertion
the file opertion is where commands are recived to write and read files...
the file opertion is a compley thing so iam going to break it down into two parts...
number one is going to be the write\read file
number two is going to be the decoder\encoder
-- interpeter
ok now is the most complex bit of all it is the interpeter ...
this is where all lose commands you type in the textediter are interperte into machine code
it is so complex that i dont think i will be able to do it all how i wont...
i no all i need do is add the commands if\for\while to make it work to apoint...

                           Interpeter For Dos_Games
                           ________________________

i have bin thinking a lot about makeing this game maker and i think it
would be beter if it was object oranted. i have not attemped to make this
befor so i will need to make it befor the interpeter. it would be of high
complexeted to acived low but if it can be acived then you could make games
a lot easyer and faster and more complex to.

you would have function like add_object...
all object would have a set of there varbs...
all object would have varbs x,y,depth,ect...
and you could add your own varbs to...
here is a exsmpal of adding a object and adding some varbs

add_object(object_name,object_image,"(shoot,0)(can_shoot,1)")
here is a exsmapl of changeing varbs...

object_name.shoot=1

seting up the game maker this way means that it is more managerbal because
you can have lose of objects with the same varbs it makes for much easyer
programing and of corse haveing it setup this way means there are actions
you can use on then like a action to move object to point x and y can be
use on all over objects. this will make gameing makeing a lot easyer to use...

to make this game maker it will take...
will i not sure how long it will take but i can gesue...
i think it will take 12 hours a day for a week and then probley it still...
won't be done finshed i think i will give up makeing it but i hope not...

if i get to make a version that is good for relesaes to the public
i will be very happy but this will mean i will need a way to send it to
pepole that will be intresed i could upload it to euphoria web site
i think that whould be the best ider and have a athachment to my web site
i will need to have the software so that no one else can take it and change
it and post it on there web site for download...
if the game maker and all its componts all work to a good stander then i
should find a way to make it in to  exe file so no gets my sorce code...
i think that might be a bit sutpide because will i do...
i coulde make it work for windows but if i get to this point i should
have so pepole helping develope the program whit me and a webs site...

-- need this #########
function check_command(sequence string)

      temp=string[pos..i-1]
      exit
    end if
 end for
--if string temp has no value then set it to string
----------------------------
if length(temp)=0 then
temp=string
end if
--check if is a command retune 1 or 0
-----------------------------

   if compare(temp,key_commands[i])=0 then
     puts(1,temp)
     ?temp
