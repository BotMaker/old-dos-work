                     sunday 4 september 2005 program started
                            ----------------------
                            day 1 www.ex zzz.ex
                            ----------------------
a new programing langwage its was made by gareth mc copyright 2005 gaz biware
it was all in one day its not that usefull at the moment but it is very fast
all the code is stall in var just onec load from a file so to speed thing
up a bit sound crap i no.

ok here are the commands

add_var
set_var
plus_var
min_var

goto
lable

if_var
if_key

exit

draw_var
draw_text
draw_line
draw_rectangle
bc
fc
cls

load_pic
draw_pic

there not many i no but it is still eraly days yet
ok here the main part leanr this and you mast it that is
the goto command with the goto command and the lable command and the if_var
command you can do just about all the stander things like makeing

loop_unitl
end loop

for i=1 to 2 do
end for

while 1 do
end while

here is a exsample of a for loop so if you can emagen you coulde program some
good shit if you want to

add_var i 1
add_var stop 10

lable start_for_loop
plus_var i 1
if_var 1 i stop goto end
goto start_for_loop

lable end
exit

you can create integer varbals but not string varbls
most commands can apecet varbls are not its up to you
ok let me show you how to add your varbs to your program
here it is

add_var x 1

you have just add varb x with value 1
you can set it to a diffrent value if you want by useing the set_var command
here it is

set_var x 2

you have just change verb x to value 2 but want if you wanted to add a varb
to a varb you would have to use the plus_var command the varb plus command
as two arguements arg1 has to be a varbs name so arg1 is x and arg2 can be a
verb or a number you type
here it is  two exsamplas

add_var x = 1
add_var move_left 4
plus_var x move_left

now x has the value 5
here it is

add_var x = 1
plus_var x 9

now x has the value 10 so now you might need takerway from a varb
here it is

min_var x 5
----------------------
to do list
----------------------
hard
-----
string system
make string varbs posabal
add string length
add get string for keyborad
might have to do i think so
add if_var_string
add plus_var_string
add add_var
add set_var
4if string system is done then can add
add data
add file_write
add file_read
and so on
------
esay er
------
add wait key prees
add get number for keyboard
add sleep
add draw_pixal
add draw_cicral
                            ------------------------
                            day 2 zzz.ex zz1.ex 
                            ------------------------
ok it has bin a bit of time i have add the posalbilty to use string varbs in
your program i thinking of adding 2d arrys to this because it would be much
beter programing landwarg i think i might give it a go now bye
i have just add the 2d array but i will say this it work good but there is
no err cheeking on it so if your program crashers then you wont no why
i can make a err system for 2d arrays but it will take some time so i will
levea it. i have only add support for 2d array with varbs at the monement i
ham thinking of makeing a 2d array system for string. i dont no what to do
now sorey i have not made a 2d array system it is a 1d array sytem 
i have just add the 1d string system so now we have a fulliy functioning
program langwagug with all varbs integer and string and 1d array varbs
so it works now i need to finsh it of that is the 1d array system

ok i have done 1d array system it work fine thinking of changeing the
set_var plus_var min_var times_var commands in to one command and with the
string system and the arrays systems to make thing more simpler
noy yet low i think a nover day or two i will do it because i do need that
doing 

just fix bugs in the 1d array system there where lose of then neahrly all
of it a to be rewriten its gone frew a lot of test and it works fine now
i need to test the program for moor bugs be for doing any thing else to it
program tested results good every thing is a ok
at the monment this programing lanlgwa is good but work needs to be started
on draw system and string function and input system. you cant make much at
the moment i dont think but it is still quirte celver

i have just made a program in my programing language it is this input string
fing you are asked to enter you name and then
to enter your age. you can use the arrow keys to move left and right and the
back space key and del key to delete a chr in string its made all in the
programing langwag its about 125 lines long it use the string remove command
and the string insert command iam thinking i might be able to make a text
editer but i will need to add commands read and write file to do so i will
try to make it sone 

it has got 37 commnads in toltil most of which are for var init and changs
so if you could make a command system read from a file and then intepe it
a=1 to add_var if var dose not exsists or set var if dose exits if i could
do this i think i would have a great program here thats not to say i dont
think its great basicly i mean make santkars for my programs

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     inportint information here
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
the programing langwiga as came a long way so far and it still as not got
a name for it so iam going to ask peopel for a name so i hope with the next
day it will have a name
-------------------------
to do list
-------------------------
---------
hard
---------
i need to make a 2d var sytem
i need to add command string copy
i need to make a text editer to prove to my self that this langwage is good
--------
esay
--------
add commands draw command about 4 to do

                     -----------------------
                        day 3 zz1.ex
                     -----------------------

ok i must say this the file zz1 as just reched 1000 lines iam pleses with
it but the the line count couled change

ok i have just made a new file its call systek.ex it interpets a=1 in to
commands that the programing langwag will understand at the monument it can
only interpit integer varbs basicly what that menans is it will interpit
a=1 or a=b it can not do string varbs our arrays varbs. at the monument
its not that cleaver because the systek has to be one way so say that
you type in this a = 1 it will not work so you have to type in a=1 for it
to work but it is claver in this sence say you type in a=1 and agina on a
diffrent line it would no that you are not add the var you are seting it to
a value and that value can all so be a varb so it is cleaver but iam not sure
how cleaver i can make it at the monument so iam going to be writeing it for
a while i think so bye for now i still here i dont no what to do now i have
noy open the zz1.ex file today i thimk trying to do two thing at one is to
hard so iam going to have to make a chours if to make systek.ex or zz1.ex
iam thinking of makeing zz1.ex i need to add loads moor commands and make
then all accept integer & string varbs and arrays and then my program should
be powerfull a noth so i can started work on systek.ex thats the plan i
think its the best ider or i can leave file zz1.ex how it is
